    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficient of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run concerning the input size. Efficient algorithms are those with low time complexity, which means they can process data quickly and are highly desirable in various applications.

        Space Complexity is another fundamental concept. It measures the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses to solve a problem based on the input size. In Big O notation, we represent Space Complexity as O(n), indicating that the space used grows linearly with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential to consider, especially in resource-constrained environments.
